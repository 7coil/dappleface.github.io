	<h1>Cyber security</h1>
	<p>You cant be secure on the internet. There is no way to protect you from anything. Right now i can be watching you though your webcam, watching you, listening to you your every word, reading your text messages, looking at where you are, reading every lie you tell anyone. All through IST i have been bored out of my mine so i hacked you, almost all of you. have fun. you may change your password every day every hour and that may beat me. are you going to? serously? there is no stopping anyone or anything you can spent money pretending you can but you cant... EVER. the only way to be secure is to take your laptop ducktape it shut, set fire to it and then bury the ashes 100M under the ground.

<h1>Dealing with Cyberbullying</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Tips for Kids and Parents to Prevent and Stop Cyberbullying</h2>
<p>Technology means that bullying is no longer limited to schoolyards or street corners. Cyberbullying can occur anywhere, even at home, via email, texts, cell phones, and social media websites 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with potentially hundreds of people involved. For those who suffer cyberbullying, the effects can be devastating, leaving you feeling hurt, humiliated, angry, depressed, or even suicidal. But no type of bullying should ever be tolerated. These tips can help you protect yourself or your child online and deal with the growing problem of cyberbullying.

<h2>What is cyberbullying?</h2>
<p>Cyberbullying occurs when a child or teen uses the Internet, emails, text messages, instant messaging, social media websites, online forums, chat rooms, or other digital technology to harass, threaten, or humiliate another child or teen. Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying doesn't require physical strength or face-to-face contact and isn't limited to just a handful of witnesses at a time. Cyberbullies come in all shapes and sizesâ€”almost anyone with an Internet connection or mobile phone can cyberbully someone else, often without having to reveal their true identity. Cyberbullies can torment their victims 24 hours a day and the bullying can follow the victim anywhere so that no place, not even home, ever feels safe, and with a few clicks the humiliation can be witnessed by hundreds or even thousands of people online.</p>
<p>If you or a loved one is currently the victim of cyberbullying, it's important to remember that you're not alone. As many of one third of teenagers have suffered from cyberbullying at some time in their lives.</p>
<h3>How cyberbullying harms</h3>
<p>The methods kids and teens use to cyberbully can be as varied and imaginative as the technology they have access to. It ranges from sending threatening or taunting messages via email, text, or IM to breaking into your email account or stealing your online identity to hurt and humiliate you. Some cyberbullies may even create a website or social media page to target you.</p>
<p>As with face-to-face bullying, both boys and girls cyberbully, but tend to do so in different ways. Boys tend to bully by "sexting" (sending messages of a sexual nature) or with messages that threaten physical harm. Girls, on the other hand, more commonly cyberbully by spreading lies and rumors, exposing your secrets, or by excluding you from emails, buddy lists, or other electronic communication. Because cyberbullying is so easy to perpetrate, a child or teen can easily change roles, going from cyberbullying victim at one point to cyberbully the next, and then back again.</p>
